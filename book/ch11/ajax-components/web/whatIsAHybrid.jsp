        A hybrid component is a JSF component that wraps a component
        from a different framework. By virtue of JSF renderers, the wrapped
        component can be anything--it needn't be limited to a component written
        in Java, for example.

        <p>In this example, the wrapped component is a JavaScript component
        from the Rico framework.</p>
