        In the Flash tradition, the Rico Accordion component is essentially
        a fancy tabbed pane with cool visual effects for transitions, as
        you can see from this demo.
        <br/>
        <p>As you might imagine, Rico developers have given you hooks
        into this component so that you can change its look and feel. In
        fact, in this demo, we do just that; see /start.jsp for details.</p>
